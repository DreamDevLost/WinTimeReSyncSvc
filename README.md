# WinTimeReSyncSvc

A simple Windows service that automatically syncs your system clock by querying Microsoft’s NTP server (time.windows.com) and applying the correct time—no Control Panel required. Ideal for installations where the built-in time sync UI is broken or unavailable. Just install the service, and it keeps your clock accurate.
